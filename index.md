Figure 3. Left: Plane induced homography between two cameras. An estimated homography in this case is only valid for this particular plane $\pi$ (defined by its normal $\mathbf{n}$ and distance $d$. Right: Homography between two cameras that have only rotation components among their reference frames. This special case is known as \textit{infinite homography} which is, unlike a general homography, scene independent.

Figure 4. Raw sample frames used in our experiments. Left to right and top to bottom: Edgewood Walmart (New Mexico), Edgewood Smith's Pharmacy (New Mexico ), Gaineville (Florida) and  Matanzas Inlet (Florida). Each image in each dataset is labelled by \\( \textit{TL} \\) (Top-Left), \\( \textit{TR} \\) (Top-Right), \\( \textit{BL} \\) (Bottom-Left) and \\( \textit{BR} \\) (Bottom-Right).
